Project 4: Code Quiz

For this project, we had to make a timed, multiple chocie quiz that would track the score of the users with updating HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I started with HTML and CSS as the framework to get the ideas 'on paper,' then rebuild it with Javascipt.

Buttons were used to control the aspects of the quiz, and keep track of high scores.

High scores were tracked in local storage, and the questions are prompted in a random order.

Each user has 75 seconds to do 10 questions. If a question is answered wrong, 10 seconds are subtracted from the total timer.

At the game over screen, the user can see their score as well as other high scores.

This is not my code - Credit to Andrew Bautista on Stack Overflow as well as countless Youtubers.
I am confident that if I didn't find a helpful example of this project, I might not have been able to submit it on time.

Huge credit to my instructors Rommel and Ringo as well, for keeping us on track.
